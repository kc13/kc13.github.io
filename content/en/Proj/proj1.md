Can we achieve Parkinsonian symptom relief that endures long after DBS offset?
<!--more-->
With conventional deep brain stimulation (cDBS), motor symptoms re-emerge rapidly if stimulation ceases.  In parkinsonian mice, the Gittis lab discovered more enduring effects following administration of a burst DBS pattern (200 ms ON, 800 OFF) to the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN). Compared to cDBS, bDBS yielded > 4*x* prolongation of the vigorous locomotion that persisted after stimulation offset. This protocol was informed by prior data that had identified two factors (differential modulation of GPe cell subtypes; targeting of STN and D1 striatal spiny neuron fibers) -- as key to generating such persistent relief[^1] [^2].

Can we extend these benefits to humans with PD?  We are conducting a nonhuman primate (NHP) investigation as a translational bridge. The translation process raises two questions:

1. Where should we stimulate in the primate brain?  The entopeduncular nucleus lacks a clear primate homologue[^3]. Our initial tests will focus on the GPe-GPi border.  

2. Will the persistent relief extend beyond the invigoration of spontaneous locomotion?  PD symptoms are diverse, and their pathophysiology is argued to be at least partially dissociable[^4]. 

From NHPs in the neurologically normal, parkinsonian, and cDBS- and bDBS-treated states, we are acquiring an extensive battery of lab- and cage-based measures.  

\[under construction: more details and figures to be added soon\]

<!-- so there is a goal to extend to humans -- and there is that work -- we are trying to do NHP -->
